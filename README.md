# Build Script 4 

This script is designed to show the following:

Create a script that uses Bash and Python to interact with any API (Some API’s will require authentication):
1. Create a CSV file of the data you choose to store in the file.
2. Only 6 columns are required for this activity (e.g. of the MLB API: Player’s name, number, team, position, height and weight).
3. The script can be interactive or not interactive (You can allow a user to pick a or some parameter).
4. CSV file must be formatted properly.
